# 📰 Fake News Prediction using NLP & Machine Learning

In today's digital world, fake news spreads rapidly and can cause serious misinformation. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical ML models.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed **20,000+ news articles**
- Applied **stopword removal** and **stemming**
- Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for feature extraction
- Trained and evaluated three models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM
- Achieved **99.27% accuracy** with **LinearSVC**
- Visualized predictions using **SHAP (explainable AI)**

## 🧪 Model Comparison

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **LinearSVC**        | 99.27%   | 99.51%    | 99.04% | 99.27%   |
| Logistic Regression  | 98.97%   | 98.85%    | 99.09% | 98.97%   |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 95.43%   | 99.27%    | 91.55% | 95.25%   |
